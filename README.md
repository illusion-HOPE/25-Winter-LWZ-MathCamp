# 25-Winter-LWZ-MathCamp
This is a course platform that provides learning resources for instruction in probability and statistics, as well as derivatives, within the scope of high school curriculum for this year's winter break.

The plan includes seven to eight formal lectures, during which we will place special emphasis on **fundamental concepts** and **the detailed proofs of basic principles**.

Due to time constraints, we will not focus extensively on skill-based problems; this portion will be covered in the review sessions of the following academic year.
